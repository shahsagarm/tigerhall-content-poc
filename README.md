## Installation

This POC requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12+ to run.
Install the dependencies to start the server.

```sh
clone the project
cd project_directory
npm i
npm start
```

> I've included .env file in the repo to make the installation process straightforward. However, I am well aware that putting .env in source control is not a good idea.
